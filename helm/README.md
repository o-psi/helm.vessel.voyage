# Helm

Helm is a TUI that connects only to local or remote Vessels. Each Vessel
supervises and exposes Voyage runtime processes, with **one session per independent
Voyage process**. See the [architecture](../docs/architecture.md).

`helm connect` combines independent voyages through authenticated local HTTP and
scoped HTTPS Vessel routes. Incoming durable updates use SSE, while commands remain
ordinary bounded POST requests. An SSH account adapter remains for compatibility.
Ordinary chat, plain chat, one-shot, workflow and managed commands
also use supervised voyage owners. Tools, policy, tasks, subagents, terminals,
workflows and lifecycle actions are authorized runtime requests. See the
[current implementation](../docs/current-state.md).

From the repository root:

```sh
cargo build --workspace --release --locked
export PATH="$PWD/target/release:$PATH"
helm --help
helm connect
helm config
helm doctor
helm chat
helm chat --plain
helm run "summarize the files in this workspace"
helm sessions
```

Configure a provider before sending a prompt. Native API providers do not require
Codex; API billing and subscription access are separate. Provider selection, local
endpoints, credentials, policy and remembered chat preferences are covered in
[configuration](../docs/configuration.md) and the
[example configuration](config.example.toml).

[Operations](../docs/operations.md) covers session controls, managed sessions,
connected local/remote voyages, supervised outbound workers, diagnostics and
recovery. `helm connect` needs the companion `vessel` and `voyage` executables. See
[security](../docs/security.md) for execution and privacy boundaries and
[development](../docs/development.md) for repository work. Automated tests and
evaluations were removed in #140; no current coverage is implied by this inventory.
